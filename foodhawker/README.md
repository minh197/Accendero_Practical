Minh Nguyen's Accendero Pratical
##Project Idea
A food hawker center is an open-air complex commonly found in Asian countries such as Vietnam, China, Singapore, and Malaysia. Through this application, users can
name their own food hawker center, create a list of dishes that will then be rendered on the site. Users will then be able to add the dish to their order and see the total price of their purchase.
##Installation Intrsuction
To install the project, you need to have node.js installed in your system. After you have cloned the project from Github to your local machine, run `$npm install` or `npm i` to install the necessary dependancies to run the project.
