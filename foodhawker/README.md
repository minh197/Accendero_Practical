# Accendero Practical

This is a web application designed to simulate a food hawker center. Users can create their own food hawker center by giving it a name and adding a list of dishes to be rendered on the site. They can then add dishes to their order and see the total price of their purchase.

## Project Idea

A food hawker center is an open-air complex commonly found in Asian countries such as Vietnam, China, Singapore, and Malaysia. Through this application, users can name their own food hawker center, create a list of dishes that will then be rendered on the site. Users will then be able to add the dish to their order and see the total price of their purchase. I built this project using React, TailWind CSS, and Firebase (to persist the state of the data).

## Installation Instructions

To install the project, you need to have node.js installed in your system. After you have cloned the project from Github to your local machine, run `npm install` or `npm i` to install the necessary dependencies to run the project.
